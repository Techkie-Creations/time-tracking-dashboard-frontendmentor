### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS Library
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) - Framework Agnostic

### Continued development

There is not really anything to add to this. So there will be no update on this maybe the CSS styling and animation.
